# Timelapse-Morphometry
For pre-clinical (microCT) and clinical data (HR-pQCT)


PRE-CLINICAL

Executes time-lapse morphometry evaluation for cortical and/or trabecular bone. Optimized for the mouse tibia.
Conceptualized by Bettina Willie, written by Annette Birkhold in 2011, and functionalized by Maximillian Rummler and Isabela Vitienes.

The code was further functionalized in 2022 by Sarah Young and Hubert Ta√Øeb.
